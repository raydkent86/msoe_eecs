CE 1911 WITH DR. JOHNSON
Man, this is a familiar spot. But witty remarks aside, I'll cut to the chase.

MAJOR CLASS TOPICS
    SYNCHRONOUS LOGIC DESIGN
        - Gate level design
        - HDL design
    DIGITAL DESIGN VERIFICATION
        - Test benches
        - FPGA implementation
    DIGITAL SYSTEM DESIGN
        - Finite state machines
        - Data paths
        - Single-cycle processors

Naturally, there's some prerequisite to all this stuff, and we can't talk about this without
talking about the digital design flow. For all this stuff, and until we do some VHDL, I'll go to my
iPad.

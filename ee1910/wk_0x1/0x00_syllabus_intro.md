# EE 1910: INTRO TO EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING #

**FIRST OF ALL** Note that there WILL NOT BE LECTURING IN THIS CLASS - all the stuff is already online and knowing it will be expected going into class, which will be a bunch of examples.

HOMEWORK
--------
* lags lecture by several days
* start early, ask questions
* don't come in the hour before it's due because Dr. Johnson lives in northern Illinois and probably won't be there

LABS
----
* 2.5 days to complete
* make sure you know what you're doing before leaving the formal lab setting
* create a plan and document on the way, or suffer through redoing work

TEXT
----
* no official text, but a good example is C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N. King
* keep in mind that it's written for a code monkey and not an engineer, so it doesn't include any of the actual physics and engineering

GRADING
-------
* grades are weighted to the highest score, and the difference between it and 100% are the number of bonus percentage points, effectively giving you a perfect score if you get the highest score in the class, which is likely not uncommonly 100%
* Dr. Johnson doesn't use the retarded grading scale, choosing to use the conventional A-F scale as used by idiots like Purdue or the University of California modified for MSOE:
> 100-91.5: A  
> 91.5-88.5: AB  
> 88.5-81.5: B  
> 81.5-78.5: BC  
> 78.5-71.5: C  
> 71.5-68.5: CD  
> 68.5-60.0: D  
> < 60.0: F
>
* HOWEVER: failure to average 60% on the tests will result in failure of the course no matter the homework, so it all evens out in the end xD
* obviously...

Because if you're learning to program, the only way you do it is to put your fingers to a keyboard. Turning in someone else's work does jack shit in terms of helping you with your career, especially given how important embedded systems has become in the electrical engineering landscape.
